# kcdc-if-you-missed-it-2019
If you missed a session at [KCDC 2019](https://www.kcdc.info/sessions) (or if you missed the whole conference), there may be a video of that session from another conference that you can see. 

Here are the ones I found. The session titles are links to their synopses on the KCDC site. When I found multiple videos for a talk, I linked to the latest one, assuming it's the most polished and up-to-date. If you know of any recordings that I didn't find, or of better recordings of the talks, let me know via a an issue or pull request.
